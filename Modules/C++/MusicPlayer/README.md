# Overview
This is a simple command-line music player built with C++. It uses the BASS audio library to play music files and the C++ filesystem library to browse a folder 
for songs. You can use it to play, pause, skip to the next or previous track, and stop playback of audio files stored in a specific folder. It works with .mp3 
and .wav files and has straightforward commands to control the music, making it easy to use. It's a basic yet functional tool for playing your favorite songs 
directly from your computer.
The purpose of this software is to showcase key C++ concepts like object-oriented programming, working with the filesystem, and integrating third-party libraries 
like BASS for audio playback. It is a practical example of building a real-world command-line application with a simple, user-friendly interface. Ideal for 
learning, hobby projects, or as a starting point for more advanced media applications.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio as the primary development environment for this project. It provided features like code editing, debugging, and project management, making 
it efficient to write and test the C++ code. Additionally, the BASS audio library was integrated to handle audio playback, and the C++17 standard library was used for 
features like filesystem manipulation.

The software is written in C++ using the C++17 standard. The program incorporates:

The std::filesystem library for scanning directories and handling file paths.
The BASS audio library to manage audio playback, including streaming .mp3 and .wav files.
C++ was chosen for its performance, control over system resources, and compatibility with third-party libraries like BASS.

# Future Work

- I need to work in stretch challenges
- Also I need to find a way to access directly every single music file inside the computer
