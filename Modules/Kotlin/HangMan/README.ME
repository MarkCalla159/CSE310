# Overview

This software is a console-based Hangman game developed in Kotlin. Players guess letters to reveal a hidden word, with 
incorrect guesses drawing parts of a hangman figure. The game tracks guessed letters, updates the word display dynamically, and 
ends with a win or loss message based on the outcome.

The project demonstrates Kotlin's capabilities in handling user input, collections, and logic with concise and readable 
syntax. It serves as an engaging introduction to Kotlin for beginners and a fun example of building an interactive application.

# Development Environment

This software was developed using IntelliJ IDEA, an advanced IDE tailored for Kotlin and Java development. It provided essential 
tools such as code completion, debugging, and an integrated build system, streamlining the development process. The Kotlin Standard 
Library was also used for core functionalities like random number generation and collection handling.

The software is written in Kotlin, a modern programming language known for its concise syntax and null safety features. It 
leverages the kotlin.random.Random class for word selection and uses collection classes like lists and sets to manage game 
state effectively.
