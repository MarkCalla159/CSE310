# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.Talk about what you are trying to accomplish 
as a software engineer to further your learning.}

The software is a backend to upload and download images

In the future I hope that I can use it to make web pages that allow file uploads in general, like a kind 
of e-commerce or a forum for students.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a 
walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

the different files I was going to need (controllers, routes, index, middlewares and the server). I started 
coding what I thought would work, with exception handling and console.log to locate errors correctly.

Typescript:
